--> Teach me like I have zero attention span. breakdown how to write best prompts on chatgpt using vivid visuals, wild metaphors and memory hacks that even lazy brain will retain



Alright, let’s do this **lazy-brain style** — fast, fun, unforgettable. Buckle up. We’re diving into how to write killer ChatGPT prompts using:

* 🍕 **Vivid visuals**
* 🐒 **Wild metaphors**
* 🧠 **Sticky memory hacks**

---

## 🧃 Step 1: Think of ChatGPT like a **genie with ADHD**

You’re not just rubbing a magic lamp — you’re **giving precise directions to a distracted genius**.
💡 **Bad prompt**: “Tell me about dinosaurs.”
⚔️ **Good prompt**: “Write a 3-minute bedtime story about a nervous T-Rex who wants to become a ballet dancer. Make it cute and rhyme.”

📌 **Memory Hack**:
🧞‍♂️ *“The genie gives what you say, not what you meant.”*

---

## 🍔 Step 2: Use the **Burger Method** (Top bun, juicy middle, bottom bun)

1. **Top bun** = context
   ➤ “I’m a college student writing a blog.”
2. **Meat** = clear request
   ➤ “Give me 5 funny tips on surviving finals.”
3. **Bottom bun** = style or format
   ➤ “Make it sound like a stand-up comedy set.”

📌 **Memory Hack**:
🍔 *No dry burgers. Context + meat + format = yum.*

---

## 🪄 Step 3: Add magic sauce — adjectives, tone, style

Don’t say:

> “Give me a summary of the Cold War.”

Say:

> “Summarize the Cold War like a dramatic movie trailer, with suspense and cheesy 80s action vibes.”

📌 **Memory Hack**:
🎬 *“Style is the seasoning. Bland in = bland out.”*

---

## 🧃 Step 4: Use Roleplay Mode (a.k.a. cosplay for prompts)

Instead of:

> “Explain black holes.”

Say:

> “You are a stoned surfer-astronaut explaining black holes to a campfire crowd. Make it trippy and chill.”

📌 **Memory Hack**:
👒 *“Put ChatGPT in costume = get wild new answers.”*

---

## 🎯 Step 5: Be selfish and specific

Vague request = vague response.

Instead of:

> “Give me business ideas.”

Say:

> “Give me 3 weird but legal business ideas for introverts who love cats and live in a small town.”

📌 **Memory Hack**:
🎯 *“Niche is rich.”*

-->tell me more about airplane------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Alright — you just hit me with:

> **"Tell me more about airplane."**

That’s like walking into a five-star restaurant and saying:

> **"Feed me something."** 🍽️

I got you… but let’s **upgrade** that prompt first. ✈️

---

## 🛠 First, Let’s Prompt-Pimp "Tell Me More About Airplane"

### 🚫 Basic Prompt:

> "Tell me more about airplane."
> ✅ You’ll get: a generic Wikipedia-sounding lecture.

---

### ✅ Upgraded Prompts Based on Vibe:

#### 🎢 **Visual Overload Version**

> "Explain how airplanes fly like you're describing it to someone tripping on a rollercoaster made of clouds. Use wild visuals."

#### 🧸 **Kid Mode**

> "Explain airplanes to a 5-year-old using toys and animal metaphors."

#### 🧙‍♂️ **Wizard Style**

> "Explain airplane mechanics like you're a wizard describing how dragons fly using science."

#### 🧛‍♂️ **Drama Mode**

> "Tell me the story of airplanes like it's a dramatic TV series — from Wright brothers to jet engines, full of betrayals and breakthroughs."

#### 🧳 **Travel Blogger**

## 🧠 Quick Lazy-Brain Memory Tip:

**“Tone + role + format = GOLD.”**
👉 Swap tone (funny, dreamy, spooky), role (wizard, teacher, chef), and format (story, list, haiku, rap).

# ✈️ **How Airplanes Fly (As Told on a Cloud Rollercoaster Trip)**

🎡 Imagine you're riding a rollercoaster made of **cotton candy clouds**, blasting through the sky with your arms up, screaming in joy—and confusion.

Suddenly, next to you, a giant metal tube with wings zooms by.
You're like: **"HOW is that Titanic-sized tin can FLOATING?"**

---

## 🌬️ **THE AIR DANCE: INVISIBLE BUT WILD**

Airplanes don’t fly because they’re fast.
They fly because they **flirt with the air** like pros.

Their wings are shaped like:

> 🥖 A baguette on top, 🍞 pancake on the bottom.

This shape **slices air in half** like a samurai sword.
Top air = goes faster.
Bottom air = goes slower.

💥 That difference? Creates **lift** — the invisible hand slapping the plane *upward* like it's high-fiving the sky.

---

## 🛞 **THRUST VS. DRAG: The Eternal Battle**

Picture this:

🦸‍♂️ **Thrust** is a superhero pushing the plane forward.
🧟‍♂️ **Drag** is a lazy zombie pulling it back.

The engine (aka **jet-powered fire cannon**) helps thrust win.
If thrust > drag, the plane zooms forward like a cheetah on a sugar rush.

---

## 🌪️ **WIND: THE INVISIBLE SLIP 'N SLIDE**

The airplane rides the wind like it’s on a **slippery sky-slide**, tilting and gliding.
Pilots use the tail bits (called elevators, rudders, ailerons — sounds like pasta but it’s airplane steering gear) to steer this beast like it’s surfing waves of air.

---

## 🧠 Lazy-Brain Visual Hack

Remember this:

> **"The wing tricks the wind, the engine punches air, and the sky plays along."**

🎢 It’s like:

* Wings = magicians
* Engines = rocket punches
* Air = invisible trampoline

Wanna hear about **turbulence as a drunk ghost shaking your seat** or a **story of two rival brothers inventing flight**?

Say the word. We keep flying. 💨


Give me a tone, a style, or a weird idea — and I’ll turn *"Tell me about airplanes"* into an unforgettable ride.

Or wanna see the **“tripping on a cloud rollercoaster”** version? I’m ready.
